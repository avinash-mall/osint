# `inference-sam3/fusion.py` — Mask-Aware Fusion + WBF / NMS

**Path:** [inference-sam3/fusion.py](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py)
**Lines:** ~520
**Depends on:** `numpy`, `pycocotools` (COCO RLE), `ensemble-boxes` (WBF, optional with NMS fallback)

## Purpose

Merge raw image candidates from SAM3 + DOTA-OBB + LAE-DINO (`grounding_dino`
layer) + MVRSD + YOLOE + SAR-CFAR into one deduplicated detection list. Builds
the canonical per-detection record (OBB extraction, COCO RLE encoding), then
runs cross-detector fusion — Weighted Boxes Fusion by default, classic
mask-aware NMS as the A/B alternative.

## Why this design

- **Mask IoU, not box IoU (NMS path)** — closely spaced objects can have ≥0.5 box IoU but ~0 mask IoU (overlap geometrically, cover different pixels). Mask-aware NMS keeps both.
- **WBF by default (T2.8)** — NMS-based ensembles destroy mAP when overlapping detectors disagree (see [why-wbf-over-nms.md](../decisions/why-wbf-over-nms.md) and the GDINO+DOTA collapse in [why-grounding-dino-auto-gated.md](../decisions/why-grounding-dino-auto-gated.md)). WBF averages overlapping boxes weighted by per-source trust instead of suppressing the loser.
- **Per-source trust weights tuned on triage set** — DOTA-OBB and MVRSD (closed-vocab specialists) at 1.0; SAM3 and YOLOE at 0.5; GDINO at 0.3 because its text-derived boxes drift; SAR-CFAR at 0.7. Operators override via `SAM3_WBF_WEIGHTS` JSON env. (The MVRSD military-vehicle specialist is default-on in the RGB profile; see [mvrsd-specialist.md](mvrsd-specialist.md).)
- **Defence-in-depth fallback** — if `ensemble_boxes` import fails, `wbf_fusion` logs a warning and falls back to `mask_aware_nms`. Runner never crashes.
- **Edge-touch detection** — a mask touching the chip edge is marked `edge_truncated=true`; downstream the worker re-stitches at chip boundaries.
- **OBB extraction from mask contour** via `cv2.minAreaRect`. Falls back to HBB when contour area tiny. The `np.where` / `cv2.morphologyEx` / `findContours` work runs on the mask's **own bounding-box ROI** (derived from cheap 1-D `any(axis)` reductions, padded by the morph kernel), not the full 1008×1008 frame, so per-detection cost is O(object) not O(image); `minAreaRect` points are offset back to full-image coords before normalising, so output is byte-identical. This is the postprocess hot path (~51 ms × N detections before the change). See [decisions/optical-inference-throughput.md](../decisions/optical-inference-throughput.md).
- **Detection-policy load order is container-first** — `parent_class_for_label` comes from the backend module, loaded by path from the first *non-empty* candidate carrying the symbol: `/app/detection_policy.py` (the compose file-mount inside the container) first, then `../backend/detection_policy.py` (dev-host checkout). The previous single-path `parents[1]/backend` resolved to `/backend` inside the container — never exists — so production always silently used the naive slugifier. The 0-byte `inference-sam3/detection_policy.py` mount anchor is rejected by the file-size guard. See [decisions/removed-empty-inference-detection-policy.md](../decisions/removed-empty-inference-detection-policy.md).

## Key symbols

- [`candidate_to_detection`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L104) — builds one detection dict from a candidate tuple.
- [`mask_to_obb_record`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L133) — `cv2.minAreaRect` on the mask contour (ROI-cropped) → OBB record.
- [`coco_rle`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L185), [`decode_rle`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L191) — base64-COCO-RLE encode/decode.
- [`mask_aware_nms`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L199) — legacy NMS path; preserved unchanged.
- [`wbf_fusion`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L258) — per-source weighted boxes fusion; stamps `wbf_member_count` + `wbf_member_sources` on survivors.
- [`fuse_detections`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L425) — env-dispatched entry point (`SAM3_FUSION_MODE=wbf|nms`); the call main.py uses.
- [`_wbf_weights`](../../inference-sam3/fusion.py#L33) — merges `SAM3_WBF_WEIGHTS` JSON env overrides on top of `_DEFAULT_WBF_WEIGHTS`.

## Inputs / Outputs

`fuse_detections(detections, *, image_w, image_h, agnostic=False) -> list[dict]`

Each input detection must carry `bbox` (normalized cxcywh), `mask_rle`, `confidence`, `class`, and `source_layer`. Output has the same shape plus, on the WBF path:
- `wbf_member_count: int` — how many input detections fused into this output.
- `wbf_member_sources: list[str]` — sorted unique `source_layer` values that contributed.

`confidence` is overwritten with the WBF-fused score (per-source-weight-rescaled mean for `conf_type="avg"`).

## Failure modes

- **`ensemble_boxes` missing** — caught at `wbf_fusion` import time; logs warning; falls back to `mask_aware_nms` with the same IoU. Verified by `test_wbf_falls_back_to_nms_when_ensemble_boxes_missing`.
- **Degenerate bbox** (zero width/height after normalization) — silently skipped before fusion; never reaches WBF.
- **Soft-NMS knob (`SAM3_NMS_SOFT=1`)** — forces NMS path even when `SAM3_FUSION_MODE=wbf`, because soft-decay is meaningless for an averaging primitive. Main.py honours this in the call-site branch.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SAM3_FUSION_MODE` | `wbf` | `wbf` → `wbf_fusion`; `nms` → `mask_aware_nms` |
| `SAM3_WBF_WEIGHTS` | empty | JSON dict `{source_layer: float}`; merges over defaults |
| `SAM3_WBF_IOU` | `0.55` | IoU threshold for WBF cluster matching |
| `SAM3_WBF_SKIP_THRESHOLD` | `0.05` | Per-input minimum confidence (WBF drops below this) |
| `SAM3_NMS_AGNOSTIC` | `1` | Cross-class dedup (both paths honour this) |
| `SAM3_NMS_SOFT` | `0` | Force NMS path with soft-decay regardless of mode |
